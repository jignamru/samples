# BabysitterApp

To set up React Native, check out: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content

To run the iOS app:

$ cd BabysitterApp
Open ios/BabysitterApp.xcodeproj and hit run in Xcode.
Open index.ios.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
Hit âŒ˜-R in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

If you get errors about fonts, you may need to run the following from the project root:

    $react-native link

To add a reference to a new font (ex: Fredericka the Great) in Xcode:

1. Know that the font files are located in the app/fonts folder.

2. Follow steps 1-4 on this page:
